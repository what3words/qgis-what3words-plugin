# What3words tools Plugin

What3words tools is a plugin for QGIS that brings the functionality of the what3words API to the QGIS platform. You can use the plugin to convert from coordinates to 3 word addresses by adding a field to a shapefile as well as searching for 3 word addresses or inspecting the map to view the 3 word address for a location.

## Installation

This plugin is compatible with QGIS v3 or later.
